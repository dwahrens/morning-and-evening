# Morning & Evening

**This repository is a PWA for Charles Spurgeon's excellent devotional: Morning & Evening.** 

This is a mobile first, installable site hosted at [morning-evening.cf](https://morning-evening.cf). I was dissastisfied with the current offerings for the daily devotional for both native and web apps. Decided to build my own that is completely offline after install. Data is stored in an IndexedDB and can be traversed using a couple of buttons.

Utilizes [russianryebread](https://github.com/russianryebread/morning-and-evening) Morning and Evening repository for the actual content. Go give that repository a star if you enjoy this app!
